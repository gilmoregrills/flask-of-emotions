#Criteria:

I will be asking you to submit a link to your app on openshift. Any of the following will have 5 points:
1- if the app is showing anything other than 404 error page!
2- if the app uses any web-based services (e.g. the sentiment analysis API that we used)
3- if the app has any data visualization (e.g. the one that we had from previous lab session)
4- if the app sets up a local data base and uses it (which we will cover tomorrow)
5- if the app has any non-trivial interactivity
6- if the app is made secure (as per criteria I will describe)
7- if the load-balancing is configured properly (here, using haproxy)

What is required: 
- There should be a navigation bar.
- There should be contact information pertinent to you
- The source codes of the app should be posted on github/bitbucket/etc as well, with proper README.MD files (Do not attempt this yet, this can be done at the end!)
- One of the apps should use a REST API of the other app (so you must create two apps)
- At least one of the apps should have auto-scaling enabled.
Please attend the lab today to find out more!
